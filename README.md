## 🤖 Development Story｜開發歷程

This app was built entirely through **conversational AI-assisted development** with Claude Sonnet 4.6, without writing a single line of code manually.
The entire codebase was produced through natural language conversation, with the human contributor acting as product owner, tester, and decision-maker throughout.

The development process unfolded across several days of iterative prompting:

**Day 1 — Prototype**
Starting from a simple idea — replacing an iPhone Notes workout log - the first React prototype was generated through a series of prompts describing the desired UI, data structure, and interaction patterns. Four versions were iterated in a single session, aimed at a clean iOS-native style.

**Day 2 — Feature Expansion**
The app gained a full exercise library system with persistent knowledge notes, a training calendar, bilingual (zh/EN) support, colour token system, and a bottom navigation bar.

**Day 3 — Deployment & Polish**
The app was deployed to GitHub Pages as a PWA via step-by-step prompting through the entire toolchain: Node.js, Create React App, gh-pages, Git, and Netlify. Issues encountered along the way (JSON syntax errors, missing React imports, corrupted index.html from TextEdit) were all diagnosed and fixed through conversation.

**Day 4 — Hardening**
A collaborative security and functionality audit — including a comparison with a separate AI agent — surfaced and resolved 8 issues: ID collision risks, date sorting bugs, i18n gaps, routing issues, and iOS PWA incompatibilities with window.alert/confirm. All were fixed through targeted prompts.

**Day 5 and counting...**
Testing, debugging and so on...
