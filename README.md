## 🤖 Development Story｜開發歷程

This project was developed entirely through AI-assisted development using Claude Sonnet 4.6, without writing a single line of code manually.

Human role:
- Product design
- UX decisions
- Testing & iteration

AI role:
- Code generation
- Debugging
- Refactoring support

The development process unfolded across several days of iterative prompting:

**Day 1 — Prototype**
Starting from a simple idea — replacing an iPhone Notes workout log - the first React prototype was generated through a series of prompts describing the desired UI, data structure, and interaction patterns.

**Day 2 — Feature Expansion**
The app gained a full exercise library system with persistent knowledge notes, a training calendar, bilingual (zh/EN) support, colour token system, and a bottom navigation bar.

**Day 3 — Deployment**
The app was deployed to GitHub Pages as a PWA via step-by-step prompting through the entire toolchain: Node.js, Create React App, gh-pages, Git, and Netlify.

**Day 4 — Hardening**
A collaborative security and functionality audit surfaced, and were all resolved: ID collision risks, date sorting bugs, i18n gaps, routing issues, and iOS PWA incompatibilities. All were fixed through targeted prompts.

**Day 5 & counting — Refactor & Bug Fixes**
v1.8.0: The entire 1,700-line codebase was modularised into 13 focused files. Five bugs were fixed (session ordering, display logic, read-only library fields, single-layer detail view). A full security audit was conducted, and monthly collapsible history was added.
